## Welcome!

As a brief introduction, my name is Star. I'm taking courses in both psychology and computer science at the University of South Carolina: Aiken.

This page serves as a sort of portfolio with detailed explanations about what each project is, what it does, and how it works. 

## IMPORTANT NOTE
I am in the process of uploading my projects and making them understandable to anyone who wants to see the code without understanding the platform it is from. Many of my projects are plugins, mods or bots designed to integrate with a completely different project. I want everything here to be as understandable as possible to people who aren't active in the same niche dev communities I am.
